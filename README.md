## Coding Styles and Principles

- Names of local variables are written using camel casing (eg. myReactions).
- Angular components are always created using "ng generate component", with names written in kebab casing (eg. discussion-board).
- Names of public static final fields are written in all upper-case, and use underscores to separate each word in the name (eg. PORT_NUMBER).
- Each line should have no more than 140 characters.
- Indents should be 2 spaces long. Use the IDE's auto-formatting tools where possible.
- Every feature should be a separate module in it's own folder inside src/features. Each feature should be split into smaller components within that module.
- All css should be inside a .css file. Avoid inline styling.
